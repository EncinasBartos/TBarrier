Computation of FTLE [1,2,3]

The demo is inside the folder "Main":

_"FTLEABCsteady": FTLE demo applied to steady ABC-flow.
_"FTLEABCunsteady": FTLE demo applied to unsteady ABC-flow.

Auxiliary functions in current folder:

_"FTLE": computes FTLE either from Cauchy Green strain tensor or gradient of the flow map.
