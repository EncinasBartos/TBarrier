Computation of PRA

The demos are inside the folder "Main":

_"PRAAgulhas.ipynb": LAVD demo applied to AVISO data set in Agulhas region

_"PRATurbulence.ipynb": PRA demo applied 2D turbulence simulation. The two dimensional turbulence dataset (velocity and vorticity fields in the folder "Data") and the advected trajectories ("particles1100.mat") for the Lagrangian calculations can be downloaded from: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/L0b0piQEqhOqNjg. The combined size of the entire dataset is approximately 10GB.

The file "PRA.ipynb" computes the PRA.
