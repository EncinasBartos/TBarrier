Computation of PRA [1,2]

The demos are inside the folder "Main":

_"PRAAgulhas": PRA demo applied to AVISO data set in Agulhas region

_"PRATurbulence": PRA demo applied to 2D turbulence simulation. The two dimensional turbulence dataset (velocity and vorticity fields in the folder "Data") and the advected trajectories ("particles1100.mat") for the Lagrangian calculations can be downloaded from: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/L0b0piQEqhOqNjg. The combined size of the entire dataset is approximately 10GB.

Auxiliary functions in current folder:

_"PRA": computes PRA from gradient of flow map.
