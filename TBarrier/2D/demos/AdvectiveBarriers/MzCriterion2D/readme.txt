Computation of MzCriterion

The demos are inside the folder "Main":

_"MzCriterionTurbulence.ipynb": MzCriterion demo applied to 2D turbulence simulation.
The two dimensional turbulence dataset (velocity and vorticity fields in the folder "Data") and 
the advected trajectories ("particles1100.mat") for the Lagrangian calculations can be downloaded 
from: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/L0b0piQEqhOqNjg. The combined size of the entire dataset is approximately 10GB.
