Computation of hyperbolic OECS using the classic algorithm introduced by [1,2]

The demo is inside the folder "Main":

_"HyperbolicOECSAgulhas": Hyperbolic OECS demo applied to AVISO data set in Agulhas region

Auxiliary functions in current folder:

_"orient_vectorfield":    Locally (within a grid-cell) re-orients the globally non-orientable eigenvector field and evaluates the                                       eigenvector at 'x' via linear interpolation
_"RK4_tensorlines":       Defines update scheme (RK4-integration) in order to integrate tensorlines.
_"scaling_vectorfield":   Rescales eigenvector so that tensorline singularites are turned into fixed points. (see [1])
_"tensorlines":           Wrapper function for RK4_tensorlines().
