Computation of FTLE [1,2,3]

The demo is inside the folder "Main":

_"FTLEAgulhas": FTLE demo applied to AVISO data set in Agulhas region

_"FTLETurbulence": FTLE demo applied to 2D turbulence simulation. The two dimensional turbulence dataset (velocity and 
                   vorticity fields in the folder "Data") and the advected trajectories ("particles1100.mat") for the Lagrangian
                   calculations can be downloaded from: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/L0b0piQEqhOqNjg. The combined size of the
                   entire dataset is approximately 10GB.

Auxiliary functions in current folder:

_"FTLE": computes FTLE either from Cauchy Green strain tensor or gradient of the flow map.
