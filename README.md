# TBarrier

This repository contains a collection of algorithms which aim to extract Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) and Objective Eulerian Coherent Structures (OECS) from discrete velocity data.

## How to Use this Book

- Run the code using the Jupyter notebooks available in this repository's [notebooks](TBarrier) directory.

## About

The handbook was written and tested with Python 3.7.

The book introduces the core algorithms essential for computing Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) and Objective Eulerian Coherent Structures (OECS) from discrete velocity data.

Familiarity with Python and its core libraries [NumPy](http://numpy.org), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) is assumed. For a quick introduction to the programming language see [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython)
