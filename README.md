# TBarrier Notebook

TBarrier Notebook contains a series of jupyter notebooks that guide you through methods to extract advective, diffusive, stochastic and active transport barriers from discrete velocity data. It implements algorithms discussed in more detail in the following forthcoming book:


G. Haller, Transport Barriers and Coherent Structures – Advective, diffusive, stochastic and methods (with the assistance of A. Encinas-Bartos). Cambridge University Press, to appear (2022)

## How to Use this Book

- Run the code using the Jupyter notebooks available in this repository's [TBarrier](TBarrier) directory.

## About

The notebooks were written and tested with Python 3.7.

Familiarity with Python and its core libraries [NumPy](http://numpy.org), [scipy](https://scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org) is assumed.

## Software

The jupyter notebooks were tested with Python 3.7.

The libraries used to run this book are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

For a complete [Installation-guideline](Installation.md) we refer to the 'Installation.md'in this repository.
