    TBarrier Notebook
</h1>

TBarrier notebooks contains a series of jupyter notebooks that guide you  through methods used to extract advective, diffusive, stochastic and active transport barriers from discrete velocity data

## How to Use this Repository

- Run the code using the Jupyter notebooks available in this repository's [TBarrier](TBarrier) directory.
